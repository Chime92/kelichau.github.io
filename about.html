    <div class=about>

      I have been intrigued with photography since age eleven when I realized how amazing it is that
      photographs can evoke different kinds of emotion in a person. Since then, I have been experimenting
      with different techniques and styles over the years to feed my curiosity and passion in this craft.
        <br/><br/>
      Besides freelancing, I'm currently at Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) working on my B.S. in psychology.
      Other than studying full-time there, I also work as an Assistant Photographer with the Office of Public
      Affairs. I organize files on our college's photography page as well as assist in set up and photographing
      various events and everyday life on campus.
