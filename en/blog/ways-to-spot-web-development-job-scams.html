                    <p>
                        On my previous blog post, I shared my experiences rejecting scam job requests for photography services and how to spot
                        them. Today, I am sharing my first experience rejecting a current new scam targeting freelance web developers and designers.
                        <br /><br />
                        Early October, I received an email requesting my web development services to update a website they currently have. They
                        started off asking questions to ease into the conversation such as if I do web design for companies and if I accept
                        credit cards. Soon after, they sent me a link to a website as an example of what they’re looking for and asked for a
                        quote ASAP. The part where it got sketchy was when they mentioned their budget of $5,000. I got suspicious because we
                        haven’t mentioned any quotes and no client would provide that detail first unless they are from referrals you know and
                        that’s still a maybe.
                        <br /><br />
                        The first sign was when I asked them for their availability to have a video/phone meeting or to meet in person if they
                        lived in the Atlanta area but they kept dodging the question. Afterward, I got too wary so I decided to search them and
                        their company as well as other examples of freelance scams for web developers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Signs to Look Out for</b>:<br /><br />
                        1. <b>Spelling Errors</b>: There are always spelling errors involved and incorrect address locations listed.<br />
                        2. <b>Impatience</b>: I was on a cruise so I couldn’t respond to any messages but I saw that this person was impatient and
                        sent me 4 emails to ask me about services. I was concerned about that but then I gave it chance because maybe they
                        thought that I didn’t get the email or maybe the server went through and they didn’t know and clicked on it multiple
                        times.<br />
                        3. <b>Unwillingness to Answer Contact Info Questions</b>: I told them that I am available to speak with them via phone, video
                        or in-person. I asked them where they lived so that I could arrange the appropriate meeting method and they kept
                        dodging the question. At this point, I started to get more suspicious.<br />
                        4. <b>Cookie-Cutter Description</b>: After they saw that I was responding, they sent me a lengthy email that was like a
                        template, detailing me on their business, what they’d like their website to look like, and their budget of $5,000. At
                        this point, I was convinced that this was not a legitimate client so I turned down the “offer”.<br />
                        5. <b>Money Enticement</b>: They tried to lure me in with $5,000 in the budget description, but little did they know that for
                        me personally, I don’t place high value on currency so I am not driven by moneymaking to the point where I’d believe
                        anything that comes my way.<br />
                        6. <b>No Alignment</b>: Their description does not match their website. For example, they would say their company’s
                        headquarters is located at such and such but their website lists a different location. That’s because they’re not using
                        their website.<br />
                        7. <b>You’ve Hit the “Jackpot”</b>: It’ll look like you’re about to get something more than you expected and if you feel that
                        way then you should take a step back and analyze the information before diving in. This is what they’ll tell you:
                        <br />
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            <p class="mb-0">
                                1. I want the same number of pages with the example site I gave you to check excluding videos and blogs<br />
                                2. I want only English language<br />
                                3. I don’t have a domain yet but I want the domain name as (domain name here)<br />
                                4. You will be updating the site for me<br />
                                5. I will be providing images, logos and content for the site<br />
                                6. I want the site up and running before the end of next month<br />
                                7. My budget is $5,000<br />
                                Kindly get back to me with an estimate asap
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of these might come off as “common sense” to some but there are novice freelancers who are eager to showcase their
                        skills and they would feel special when someone is reaching out to them and end up falling for the scam. Let’s spread
                        the word on the web so these scammers can be spotted and after they’ve evolved to another method, we will continue to
                        find and report them.
