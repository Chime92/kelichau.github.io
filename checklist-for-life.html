                  We are expected to play this game in our lives where we need to protect our reputation because that will bring us entitlement
                  (For what? For people to like us? Power?) As the years pass by and we become more modern, we see more expression being done,
                  but at the same time, we can't do too much of it. Majority of people do not express themselves at all. Unless the person has 
                  reputation, that is only when others will listen to them. But for most of us "little" folks, we do not have that title, so 
                  when we do express our emotions or thoughts, we are considered vulgar, immature, stupid, and impulsive.
                    <br/><br/>
                  Afraid of losing face, people would rather choose to put on a mask than stand up for what they believe in, or something even
                  more simple&mdash;to express who they are. They choose to follow rather than lead. They choose a job based on the salary
                  instead of the content of that job, believing that money would bring them happiness, not realizing that it only brings them 
                  convenience to provide for the things they need&mdash;housing, transportation, food, and clothes. All of these things are
                  not taught by our parents. No, because all they say to their children is that this is "just" the method, this is "just"
                  how you need to do things. They never explain why. Why we need a house so big when you have to work long hours to pay for 
                  it and unable to spend time in it, why we need a car plastered with a symbol that is considered royalty in society, why we
                  need 1,000 combinations of outfits that we won't all wear.
                    <br/><br/>
                      <ul style="list-style-type:bullet" class="list-alignment">
                        For that kind of lifestyle, they follow this particular checklist:
                        <br/><br/>
                          <li>Graduate high school</li>
                          <li>Attend/graduate college or start working</li>
                          <li>Make tons of money</li>
                          <li>Find a partner</li>
                          <li>Have biological child(ren) or adopt</li>
                          <li>Raise child(ren) with same utilitarian ideals and checklist</li>
                          <li>Retire and finally be happy</li>
                      </ul>
                    <br/>
                  I have been surrounded by these like-minded people throughout my life and 18 years of education. While everyone was working
                  hard to get a SAT score that is good enough for their dream college, I went with the flow of things. They felt like they 
                  needed to get into a reputable college, believing that would give them answers about their identity. I only saw one other
                  person that did not care about the status quo and passionately pursued their interests. Honestly, if I didn't get any
                  scholarships that covered my tuition and fees, I wouldn't have went to college at all.
                    <br/><br>
                  On top of my gender, I also have Asian cultural expectations of how a female is suppose to act. Some people say that I'm 
                  outspoken like an American, but that's not entirely true either. There are plenty of Asian-Americans who follow that 
                  cultural expectation. Most people say that I (am) "overthink, overreact, and overemotional," as if I make everything up
                  about how others treat me, but at the same time, they can't deny the things I do and say. People do not realize how much
                  I see and know what they think of me, how they treat me, and how I always find out what they say about me behind my back. 
                  They have always viewed me the fool, so I let them believe it.
                    <Br/><br/>
                  Note sure if it's my education, where I decided to go to college, what I decided to study, or because I've always been 
                  expressive of what I thought, (being interpreted as vulgar and stupid), people all around me thought at best, I'd end up
                  with the typical 9-5 job and at worst, I'd end up dropping out, have kids, and become a nail technician, as if the latter
                  is such a horrible thing to happen. I know plenty of women who "fits this stereotype" and I respect them more than 99%
                  of those that has a college degree.
