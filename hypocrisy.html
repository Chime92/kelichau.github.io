                  <div class="blog-content">
                    Based on Merriam-Webster, 'Hypocrisy' is defined as "the behavior of people who do things that they
                    tell other people not to do; behavior that does not agree with <a name="hypocrisy-start"><a class="links2">what someone claims to believe or feel".
                    Google defines it as, "the practice of claiming</a></a> to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own
                    behavior does not conform".
                      <br/><br/>
                    I am the kind of person who is always conscious of my words and 
                    actions before it happens, while it is happening, and when it happened. When it comes to hypocrisy, I believe that
                    no one can truly escape from it simply because human beings are capable of emotions. Logic might tell you to do one thing,
                    but your feeling might swing you the other direction. When that happens to me, I always choose to make a decision based
                    on how I am feeling. Even if I end up making a mistake, I do not regret that choice I made because it was <i>my</i> mistake.
                    This could be associated with recklessness, but I believe that as long as you are not intentionally hurting anyone, then you
                    will only hurt yourself if you make a decision that you will regret ten years down the line.
                      <br/><br/>                   
                    Before I continue with this post, I would like to point out that what I am about to discuss is not one of those 
                    cliché stories when people exaggerate how one, maybe two, people treat them, and subsequently become obsessed and insecure because of it. 
                    I say that because for the most part, that is what people tell me when they give me advice since they do not know the whole story. You 
                    know, the typical, "*Sigh*, it’s OK Keli, don’t worry about what others think of you" (and yet, when I encourage others to be themselves, 
                    I get backlash). I slowly became accustomed to not reaching out to anyone for advice due to the lack of information they have about a situation.
                      <br/><br/>
                    Throughout the first quarter of my life, I have met different groups of people through school, events, and relationships. I intentionally say 'group' 
                    instead of 'kind' because I noticed that everyone tends to find their own little group of people that they enjoy surrounding themselves with. 
                    However, for me, I do not fit in with a group, and contrary to popular belief, I am okay with that. From pre-school till this day, I have always 
                    enjoyed doing things on my own. That is because I think differently from my peers so when it comes to finding things to do on a Saturday evening, scheduling
                    a vacation itinerary, or where to go for lunch, my visions are usually different from theirs.
                      <br/><Br/>
                    I have never been one to turn my cheek when it comes to something I am not associated with or have a lack of understanding of, but I had not realized 
                    that most people would. Based on how the majority react to controversial issues such as whether or not to be understanding of the recent legalization of gay 
                    marriage, or when a person decides to change their lifestyle to veganism, it has shown me that they are not susceptible to change when it does not fit 
                    in with their perspective which is often with traditional ways. I think that is also one of the reasons why people will not express themselves because 
                    they are afraid of having to deal with the consequences for speaking, thinking, and behaving "out of terms".
                      <Br/><Br/>
                    Well, to tie this back to the subject of hypocrisy, I wanted to connect how firm a person’s set of beliefs are to how much or how little they will end up 
                    contradicting themselves in their everyday actions. When you are able to stand up for what you believe in even if you are standing alone, that will show 
                    how strong you are, and how much you believe in yourself. In order to achieve that, you must first acknowledge who you really are and accept it, all of 
                    which requires one thing—awareness.
                      <br/><Br/>
                    When people do not follow the crowd, they get viewed as, "That person is trying too hard to be different," or "That person thinks they are special," or 
                    something as simple as, "That person is wrong". I find that ironic simply because I also see them emphasize the importance of being different, but then 
                    they make decisions based off of their fears of being seen and treated as an outcast. Some recent situations I could think of is how the majority of the people that 
                    I am acquainted with treat me. They started to treat me strangely because I am the odd one out, due to my willingness to be outspoken about my opinions 
                    and point out when something is not correct.
                      <br/><br/>
                    You see, some people would intercept with my previous sentence by telling me that I need to say things in a different way. They do not seem to realize 
                    that no matter how much you try to fluff up the truth, which most people do not like to listen to, it will still have the same effects because they 
                    already developed a bias toward me. Not only that, take this example I have used before: "I am sorry, but I have to let you go," vs "You are fired," 
                    will still end up with a disgruntled former employee. I thought about how perhaps it is sexism or reputational, but after seeing how they treat other 
                    girls that do not have a "reputation" as well, it is not like how they treat me at all. It is a little bit of everything, but they treat me how they 
                    do because of a developed bias on me. Throughout all of my interactions with them, they have eyes focused on seeing and sometimes even creating the worse 
                    conclusions they can about me.
                      <br/><Br/>
                    It took a while, but the day that I decided that I have reached my limits, I started to slowly stand up for myself and stopped being polite to these same 
                    people. No one else was going to do it; this is my life and who I choose to surround myself with also defines me. That was when they started to show 
                    their true colors and stopped showing the overlaying mask of politeness they insisted on having because of a mutual friend. They do not see how contradictory 
                    their behaviors are—they were the ones that started treating me like I am some sort of criminal even though I have never done anything to them and when I 
                    started to stick up for myself, they got annoyed and kept this silent grudge on me, creating this cold war every time I attend social events with them. On 
                    top of that, when I stand up for myself, it only makes them think that I proved their points correct about how they think of me. All of this makes me 
                    scratch my head even more; are they so blind to see that I am not the one that they should be wary of? They emphasize the importance of actions but disregard 
                    mine. My words and actions have always aligned while theirs do not. They insist that my gift-giving to be a kiss-up or as a 'one-up' and my concerns to 
                    fakeness, all the while falling for these same social traps they have set out for themselves.
                      <br/><br/>
                    I cannot prevent how these people will continue to treat me and I certainly cannot control how they view me. If they insist on believing that I am this 
                    horrible person that they cannot trust, there is nothing I could do but to continue to be myself. I can continue to give gifts even if they will continue 
                    to think that all I care about is 'one-upping' them on what they give me. I will continue to express who I am even if they will continue to think I am 
                    this immature and insecure (or whatever they call me) person. It is scary to find out what people, young and old, say about you behind your back. Do they not 
                    realize by now that paper cannot cover fire?
                      <br/><br/>
                    I wanted to write this post because I have experienced countless situations where people I know treat me like an outcast because I do not behave like the 
                    rest of the crowd, and I wanted to share it with anyone who may be experiencing something similar to this. From this post, I hope that you will be able to 
                    become a little bit more aware of yourself to realize whether or not you are experiencing what I talked about. Perhaps you are in my shoes or perhaps you
                    are in their shoes. My point is, do not be afraid to be who you are. This is not new philosophy, but it is definitely hard when your endurance is challenged. 
                    If the people around you does not accept you for who you are, maybe it is time for you to find new people to surround yourself with. People who will help 
                    lift you up in your endeavors and vice versa. One last bit that I will leave you is this: do not play the game if it is not the game you are interested 
                    in playing.
