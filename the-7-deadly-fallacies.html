                  There's no way for me to say any of these things without offending people, be misunderstood, or have whatever insult that may be sent my way. 
                  Let me be clear about this&mdash;I have never expected anyone to blindly follow and support me. However, I also never expected anyone I know to ever 
                  intentionally try to discourage me either. If you're not an open-minded person or if you get offended easily, I suggest you read no further.
                  <br/><br/>
                  This post will be about my opinions on the negative views people have on me. You may be thinking that I'm a hypocrite and insecure for doing this, 
                  but the purpose of this post is to point out the flaws in your argument. If you already view me a certain way, more than likely, you won't ever 
                  understand what I'm about to say. If that's the case, I feel sorry for you. If you go on with life living in a narrow-minded manner, imagine all 
                  of the good things you're missing out. (No, I'm not claiming to be the best thing ever that you're missing out. See my point?)
                  <br/><br/>
                  There will be a total of seven fallacies that I'll talk about. For each fallacy mentioned, a definition from Purdue Owl will be presented. 
                  There will be a particular focus for each fallacy, on the general topic that I will be addressing. Feel free to input your opinions because 
                  I'm always up for a friendly debate. I haven't taken a philosophy course, and I'm not planning on it, so if there are any misuse of the terms 
                  or any obvious contradictory popping at you in this post, please leave me a comment stating so and provide a substantial amount of support to 
                  back up your argument.
                  <br/><br/>
                  If you aren't familiar with the term "fallacy" in regards to arguments, Purdue Owl defines it as "common errors in reasoning that will undermine 
                  the logic of your argument. Fallacies can be either illegitimate arguments or irrelevant points, and are often identified because they lack evidence 
                  that supports their claim. Avoid these common fallacies in your own arguments and watch for them in the arguments of others." It goes on to explain 
                  the 12 fallacies listed. I will be using 7 of those 12 to explain what I would like to talk about.
                  <br/><br/>
                  We live in a world where our reputation is seen as equally important to our character. I disagree with that. Because of my disagreement, my actions 
                  and words have offended others. When I say or do something, there are always a majority of people who are, very few may be out of their good heart, 
                  telling me to stop because they don't think it's the right thing to do. If you're reading this and you think you're one of the people I'm talking about, 
                  you're probably right. However, remember that I'm not only talking about you. There are plenty of others that would gladly take your side.

                  1. <b>Slippery Slope</b>: "This is a conclusion based on the premise that if A happens, then eventually through a series of small steps, through B, C,..., X, Y, Z 
                  will happen, too, basically equating A and Z. so, if we don't want Z to occur, A must not be allowed to occur either." &
                  <br/>
                  2. <b>Genetic Fallacy</b>: "This conclusion is based on an argument that the origins of a person, idea, institute, or theory determine its character, nature, or worth."
                  <br/><Br/>
                  I'm a college student. I'm studying psychology at Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC). GGC is a fairly new school and is in the process of establishing its place in GA. 
                  Back in high school when I told others I went to Meadowcreek, they gave me the same reaction as when I tell them I'm at GGC&mdash;disgust, pride, a little bit of 
                  joy&mdash;that they have something "over" me. As if GGC didn't already give others a slightly worse impression of me, I am studying psychology. Which, as you might 
                  already know, is looked down on by well, everyone, with some minor exceptions. For one reason or another, people take where you go to school and what you study 
                  seriously. I'm not talking about employers either.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Because of this reason, people automatically assume that I might be one of the percentage that will either drop out of college, get pregnant "too early" 
                  (which I have nothing against), or both. If not those two things, then they have the impression that I won't be able to make it to the "top," get rich, 
                  and be happy. Perhaps it's all of the above. Correlation isn't causation. Although I am not at UGA, Emory, GA Tech, etc., studying medicine, business, 
                  or something "good," it doesn't equate to me to not finding "success" in my future. 
                  <br/><Br/>
                  You may be thinking: Well, if you didn't care about what others think of your education, why are you writing about it? 
                  My answer: Perhaps you should look at the actions I'm taking and not have a bias focus solely on the words I say. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  If I cared, I would have transferred to UGA, got my degree in accounting, established my name through clubs, and aimed to get a job at one of the big four. 
                  (This isn't in any way me trying to bash on those who have took this route. It's to prove the point that I don't care about what school I attend). I chose to 
                  stay at GGC to study what I enjoy learning for less. I rather be close to my family, not have to owe a huge amount of student loans upon graduation, or 
                  worry about rent or food. During my first couple of years of college, people kept asking me when I was going to transfer. I continued to give them the answer 
                  I thought they wanted to hear, but it lacked confidence. I had a decision to make&mdash;either to do what others expect of me or follow the path less traveled. 
                  I chose the latter.
                  <br/><Br/>
                  What does success mean to you, anyway? Money? Fame? Happiness? All of the above? Well, you can't always have everything. There are always sacrifices to be made. 
                  People often forget what the main goal in life is&mdash;it's to be happy. They get distracted with all the buzz around them. They equate the school you attend 
                  to the job you'll receive ($), to how happy you will be. Well, let me ask you this: Why let external factors determine your happiness? Why delay happiness 
                  until you have a lot of money? Do you still think A causes B?
                  <br/><Br/>
                  If you are one of the people who are going along with what your family and friends expect of you, are you happy with your decision? I see a ton of people 
                  complaining about school or the work they're doing. That they can't wait to graduate to do this and that. That they can't wait to get a vacation. If you really 
                  enjoyed studying to become _______, you would be fully invested into it and be interested in studying to become that very thing. Once you graduate, you 
                  should be happy to spend all of your time on it, sometimes even forgetting about eating or sleeping because you are happy with your work.
                  <br/><Br/>
                  3. <b>Ad populum</b>: "This is an emotional appeal that speaks to positive (such as patriotism, religion, democracy) or negative (such as terrorism or fascism) 
                  concepts rather than the real issue at hand."
                  <br/><br/>
                  Certain people already have a bias towards me, especially those in the past and those that believe they understand me. At one point or another, they gossip to 
                  each other when I say or do something that seems bizarre to them. Due to this reason, I get associated with variations of negative labels. They neglect my 
                  opinion because it's different from the majority rather than trying to understand the situation themselves. In other words, their negative bias on me will 
                  continue to prevent them to ever learn how to understand what I do or say.
                  <br/><Br/>
                  4. <b>Hasty Generalization</b>: "This is a conclusion based on insufficient or biased evidence. In other words, you are rushing to a conclusion before you 
                  have all the relevant facts."
                  <br/><br/>
                  Whenever I say something in person or share something on my social media, people make a rushed decision about who I am as a person. For those that don't 
                  interact with me in a daily basis, which is a lot of people, they can only use the next best thing: Facebook. These judgements are made within seconds of an 
                  action and are always wrong.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Based on the relations I had with others in the past, I can safely say that they all think on a similar plane when it comes to how they view my personality, 
                  which they claim is my character. Apparently people can't tell the difference or don't think there's a difference between the two. Plenty of people have 
                  mentioned to me, or behind my back, (which eventually led back to me), that I am insecure, negative, cynical, and/or self-righteous. They make these quick 
                  assumptions about who I am as a person, and ultimately, where I will get in my life. Ex: People assume that I don't know how to have fun because I'm a 
                  serious person.
                  <br/><br/>
                  I remember I wrote a status on my Facebook (which consists of people I know in person) a month ago in regards to the cover videos I've been sharing on YouTube. 
                  It went something like this: "People from my Facebook clicks on my videos just to 'dislike' them. And people say I'm the cynical one. No, I'm just an honest person." 
                  When I share my videos onto Facebook (plus the mutual friends that would see it from when my boyfriend shares it onto his Facebook, and then when people "like" it 
                  and it'll pop up onto mutual friends' ticker b/c the post was changed to public view&mdash;all of which are still people I know in person and may not have added on my 
                  Facebook account), it will receive dislikes. When I don't share it, it won't. Especially because I am a start-up and I don't have a lot of content or views yet, 
                  those dislikes made it peculiar. There are a lot of other people I see on YouTube who are "worse" than me and have more views than me, and yet have no "dislikes".
                  <br/><Br/>
                  My intention in writing that status was to point out two things: 
                  <br/><Br/>
                  1) If I'm cynical, then what should you call the people who are purposefully trying to discourage someone they know in real life? 
                  <br/>
                  2) Why did they send/accept the "friend" request if they obviously have something against me? (Even if they aren't on my friends list, only the people who 
                  know would be curious enough to watch it to begin with).
                  <br/><Br/>
                  However, there were some people who responded to the status by telling me that I should continue what I've been doing without caring about what others think of 
                  me. Though I appreciate the support they gave, they seem to have missed the purpose of the status, and it was not because I care so much what others think of my singing. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  When I write comments similar to the one I mentioned above (another recent one comes to mind regarding a photography project), people tend to make a 
                  hasty assumption that I am an insecure person. What I have learned that's associated with insecurity is that it's believed to cause negativity -> 
                  unhappiness -> failure. Taking time to blog about something is different from letting it get to you. It's similar to how Billy Joel, Adele, 
                  and all other artists express their feelings through song-writing, painting, and other forms of medium. Not sure if you noticed by now, 
                  "Chicken in a Turtle Shell – Learning to be Comfortable with Being Uncomfortable" is a blog about stepping out of your comfort zone to learn new things. 
                  In order to learn new things, I have to stay open-minded to constructive feedback and when people simply 'like' or 'dislike' something, it doesn't give me 
                  anything constructive. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  Some people might tell me to ignore the negativity, but to me, that's running away from the problem. Life is about accepting both the good and the bad. 
                  You can't ignore the negativity and expect it not to affect you. It does. That's why people often end up spending money on materialistic things, constantly 
                  eat out, go partying, resort to drugs, share intimate details of their lives on social media, etc., to prolong the issue they have at hand. A problem delayed is 
                  not a problem denied. It will come back and eat you. I'm not the kind of person to beat around the bush, and sure, to most of you, that's inconsideration, 
                  but when your actions show me otherwise, you're contradicting your own beliefs. It was never about how someone says something, it has always been about 
                  who says it.
                  <br/><br/>
                  5. <b>Straw Man</b>: "This move oversimplifies an opponent's viewpoint and then attacks that hollow argument."
                  <br/><br/>
                  The scenario that I'll use for this is when people say "I care too much or over-think things". For example, right now, if you've read to this point, 
                  and don't agree with at least half of the things so far, then you are probably thinking that this post is all about me caring too much about what others 
                  think of me. Truthfully I don't mind about what others say but I'm more curious about why they would say or do something a certain way, especially when it's 
                  from people that I've known in person. If people can't learn to try to understand an opinion different from their own, they should at least know how to 
                  respect it and not use it against that person because of it. It's easier to undermine what I say and do and pass it off as immaturity rather than trying to 
                  thoroughly understand the situation. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  Perhaps you've already made a decision about what kind of person you think I am, (as you probably do for everyone else in your life), and you think that you're 
                  being the "bigger person" or the "mature" one by not saying anything to me, and continue letting me be "immature" one. Or you think you're helping me by letting 
                  me "learn on my own" and that I'll think differently as I get older, and when I look back to this stage of my life, I would think to of how foolish and 
                  silly I was to act and think this way.
                  <br/><Br/>
                  6. <b>Ad hominem</b>: "This is an attack on the character of a person rather than his or her opinions or arguments."
                  <br/><br/>
                  You should have an idea of what I'm trying to explain by now. The "bad track record" that's been following me around allows the people who have interacted 
                  with me to continue to be persistent about how they view me. Up to this point, people don't pay attention about the content I'm sharing. Let's face it, 
                  people take Facebook seriously. That's why they are afraid to speak their minds openly. That's why their “likes” and comments exist only when they want and are okay to be 
                  associated with something or someone. I never took social media seriously. The fact that this is my fourth account and I still went and added everyone from my 
                  old profile knowing what they will think, should show that. Oh, and to be fair, my boyfriend opened the same amount of accounts, and people never said the same 
                  thing to him that they have to me. Double standards, much?
                  <br/><Br/>
                  7. <b>Circular Argument</b>: "This restates the argument rather than actually proving it."
                  <br/><br/>
                  "Keli is insecure because she cares too much about what others think of her. She cares too much about what others think of her because she's insecure."
                  <br/><br/>
                  Those that believe this are reasserting their claim and not supporting their accusation without any further evidence. It's like saying "I believe that 
                  Frosted Flakes are great because it says so on the Frosted Flakes packaging".
                  <br/><Br/>
                  Well, that's everything I wanted to cover. Appreciate you reading this far, whether or not you agree with the things I wrote. If you are up for a friendly 
                  debate, fire away.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Who knows, this whole post could be a fallacy.
