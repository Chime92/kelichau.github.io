                      <br/><br/>
                    Do you agree with the statement above? This is something that I have been observing throughout the years.
                    Perhaps the people most supportive of you are judging you solely on your work. Maybe they don't 
                    know you personally so they can't make any judgement about what kind of person you are. For those that are more 
                    relative, it could be their partial judgement because of their relationship with you, or perhaps it could even
                    be their insecurities. I think a lot of you could relate to this, whether or not you realize this yourself or
                    have spoken openly about it.
                      <br/><br/>
                    When I say "less relative" I mean the ones that are usually, but not always, your acquaintances. Someone that 
                    only knows you from school, from an event, or from what you share on your social media, but they have nothing 
                    else to judge you on. That decreases bias and allows them to judge you based solely on the work you are sharing and 
                    how you are representing yourself.
                      <br/><Br/>
                    I believe your immediate family should be excluded from this theory. Parents and siblings are always (or I hope 
                    they should be) supporting you, no matter what you do. I am fortunate enough to have that and incredibly grateful 
                    for it. Besides the support from immediate family, if you are lucky enough to find true friendship, then you are 
                    one in a million. You might not need me to say this, but be sure to appreciate those relationships. Here is a list of
                    reasons why I think people who are more relative to you may not necessarily support your endeavors, and my tips to 
                    overcome it, if this is the case in your situation.
                      <br/><Br/>
                    <u>Reasons</u>
                      <Br/><br/>
                    1. <b>Biasness</b>: People who are closer to you will <i>tend</i> to have a higher chance of making an accurate decision about you.
                    They are more likely to believe what they think is true because they have the perception that they understand who you are, based
                    on the amount of tie and relationship they have with you. Perhaps it's because you are closer to them. Humans have an innate 
                    competitiveness and that occurs more with the people you know. Sometimes it could be your cousin wanting to compare their children
                    with yours or their successes with you. For example, they might feel the importance to want to end up with a bigger house than you,
                    a "better" reputable alma mater, or a more expensive car. This sounds a bit vain, and usually this kind of competitiveness is external
                    and short-term.
                      <br/><br/>
                    2. <b>Underestimation</b>: This ties a little bit into number one. Majority of people only respect others that have a "good" reputation.
                    A "good" reputation entails a high salary, owning expensive objects (interpreted as high quality), and/or having better social experiences
                    (showing that you have money to spend). All of which are branches off of your career and whether or not you attended college, and if so, where and what? Is
                    it an ivy league? If not, is it at least a <i>popular</i> state university? The college you attend only <i>correlates</i> to the job you 
                    receive upon graduation, but is not necessarily causation. However, people tend to be quick to believe that the determination of a person's
                    life and their worth is from the college they attended and the salary they will be make afterwards.
                      <br/><br/>
                    3. <b>Passive-Aggressiveness</b>: We all have or had that passive-aggressive relationship with someone. Be it your family member, relative,
                    friend, or acquaintance. Depending on how you let it affect you, this could actually be very unhealthy. If you do have one of these relationships,
                    I recommend you to either slowly distance yourself from them or just build a good tolerance and learn how to handle the relationship so that it 
                    wont negatively affect you. Personally, I just cut people out of my life because I don't have time to play waiting games with them, but I understand
                    that most of you do not want to take that route lest you want to ruin your reputation. Moving on, these PA people will tend to "want" to support you
                    but might have an ego in which they only feel that they wouldn't want you to become better than them (on their own definition), due to their
                    innate competitiveness. They might not be aware of their actions, but nonetheless, you should always surround yourself with people who have similar 
                    principles to you, mostly people who are confident and have strong passion toward their beliefs and goals, as well as know how to support others
                    wholeheartedly and not the half-assed claimed support that PA people tend to give.
                      <br/><Br/>
                    4. <b>Insecurity</b>: All of the reasons above are in some way related to insecurity. If a person is one hundred percent confident, that person understands
                    what it takes to be happy. If a person is truly happy, they are at peace and know how to focus on their goals while being considerate at the same time
                    to the ones around them. A confident person will not have the time to think about comparing themselves to others, let alone act on it. They would  
                    be spending their time wisely to find ways to improve themselves, learn new things about who they are, and spending time with their loved ones.
                      <br/><br/>
                    <u>Tips</u>
                      <br/><Br/>
                    1. <b>Be Understanding</b>: Understand that these people are human beings. <i>You</i> are human. We all make mistakes and our own personal struggles.
                    Don't hold these things against them especially if it seems as if they aren't even aware of doing it to you. It's tiring and takes you nowhere if you choose
                    to play their game. It's better to accept things the way they are and this does not mean that you have to keep up a facade of interacting with them in your life.
                    No need to cut yourself from society but find a balance.
                      <Br/><br/>
                    2. <b>Be the Initiator</b>: If you want to see where a person stands in your life and whether or not they support you, just be honest to them and yourself. 
                    If you really want to know, you can take the initiative and ask them what they think of you. This is a two-way street, so of course you need to also be genuinely 
                    supporting them as well. Be the best judge that you can be in picking the right people that are supportive of you and have similar beliefs as you.
                      <Br/><br/>
                    3. <b>Be Open-Minded</b>: Keep an open mind. Don't jump to conclusions if you don't have enough evidence about where a person stands in your life. Don’t always believe what 
                    you hear and see. Things might not always be as they seem. If you keep an open mind, it will allow you to listen better, and, ultimately, learn better. It'll help you to not 
                    remain stubborn if you find out that you were wrong about something, you'll learn from your mistakes. You are a student of your life. Don’t ever settle for a mediocre one. 
                    You don't know what happens when you die, so definitely make the best of it. Human beings are social creatures, so relationships are just as an important part of everyone's 
                    lives. If you can learn to be open to new ideas, you will be able to get along with all different kinds of people and learn from them.
                      <Br/><br/>
                    4. <b>Be Inspiring</b>: If you notice these things and you have no idea how to handle it, just be yourself and that'll be inspiring, by being the honest you. Use whatever it is that you're doing to 
                    show them that you are persistent and serious. If you want to become a teacher, work hard on your goals and become one. If you want to become your own boss of a restaurant and 
                    there are doubts coming your way, just work hard for your goals. Accomplish your goals and when the time comes with the result, you can show those people. I don't mean shove it 
                    in their face. I mean to show them that because you were able to do it, so can they. Most of the time, people who are insecure or underestimate others only do so because they 
                    don't think they can amount to something themselves. Having someone relative to them, showing them otherwise, could definitely be a huge motivation.
                      <br/><br/>
                    Of course, there are always other possible explanations. I could be one hundred percent incorrect. I came up with these reasons and tips based off of my experience on being on both sides of 
                    the coin. I'll always keep an open-mind and maybe you were able to do the same while you were reading this post.
                      <br/><br/>
                    What do you think about this innate competitiveness that we all have experienced at one point or another? Do you agree with anything I've written? Disagree? Feel free to let me know if you're 
                    interested in a discussion. 
                      <br/><br/>
                    As always, thanks for reading and feel free to leave some feedback on what you would be interested in seeing or what I can improve to make this a better reading experience for you.
