            <div class=blogcont>
              Based on Merriam-Webster, 'Hypocrisy' is defined as "the behavior of people who do things that they tell other people not to do; behavior that does not agree with what 
              someone claims to believe or feel". Google defines it as, "the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform".
                <br/><br/>
              I would like to think that I am the kind of person who is always conscious of my words and actions before it happens, while it is happening, and when it happened. When 
              it comes to hypocrisy, I believe that no one can truly escape from it simply because human beings are capable of emotions. Logic might tell you to do one thing, but 
              your feeling might swing you the other way. When that happens to me, I always choose to make a decision based on how I am feeling. Even if I end up making a mistake, 
              I do not regret the choice I made because it was my mistake. This could be associated with recklessness, but I believe that as long as you are not intentionally 
              hurting anyone, then you will only hurt yourself if you make a decision that you will regret ten years down the line.
                <br/><br/>
              Before I continue with this post, I would like to point out that what I am about to discuss is not one of those cliche stories when people exaggerate how one, maybe 
              two, people treat them and they become obsessed and insecure because of it. I say that because for the most part, that is what people tell me when they give me advice 
              since they do not know the whole story. You know, the typical, "*Sigh*, it is okay Kelly, do not worry about what people think of you." I slowly became accustomed to 
              not reaching out to anyone for advice due to the lack of information they have about a situation.        
                <br/><br/>
              Throughout my first quarter of life, I have met different groups of people through school, events, and relationships. I intentionally say 'group' instead of 'kind' 
              because I noticed that everyone tends to find their own little group of people that they enjoy surrounding themselves with. However, for me, I do not fit in with a 
              group, and contrary to popular belief, I am okay with that. From pre-school till this day, I have always enjoyed doing things on my own. That is because I think 
              differently from my peers so when it comes to finding things to do on a Saturday evening, scheduling a vacation itinerary, or where to go for lunch, my visions are 
              usually different from theirs. 
                <br/><br/>
              I have never been one to turn my cheek when it comes to something I am not associated with or have a lack of understanding of, but I had not realized that most people 
              would. Based on how the majority react to controversial issues such as whether or not to be understanding of the recent legalization of gay marriage, or when a person 
              decides to change their lifestyle to veganism, it has shown me that they are not susceptible to change when it does not fit in with their perspective which is often 
              with traditional ways. I think that is also one of the reasons why people will not express themselves because they are afraid of having to deal with the consequences. 
                <br/><br/>
              Well, to tie this back to the subject of hypocrisy, I wanted to connect how firm a person's set of beliefs are to how much or how little they will end up contradicting 
              themselves in their everyday actions. When you are able to stand up to what you believe in even if you are standing alone, that will show how strong you are, and how 
              much you believe in yourself. In order to achieve that, you must first acknowledge who you really are and accept it, all of which requires one thing&mdash;awareness. 
                <br/><br/>
              When people do not follow the crowd, they get viewed as, "That person is trying too hard to be different," or "That person thinks they are special," or something as 
              simple as, "That person is wrong". I find that ironic simply because I also see them emphasize the importance of being different, but then they make decisions based 
              off of their fears of being seen weird. Some recent situations I could think of is how the majority of the people that I am acquainted with treat me. They started to 
              treat me strangely because I am the odd one out because of my willingness to be outspoken about my opinions and point out when something is not correct. 
                <br/><br/>
              You see, some people would intercept with what I said in the previous sentence by telling me that I need to say things in a different way. They do not seem to realize 
              that no matter how much you try to fluff up the truth, which most people do not like to listen to, it will still have the same effects. I have used this example before,
              but "I am sorry, but I have to let you go," vs "You are fired," will still end up with a disgruntled former employee. I thought about how perhaps it is sexism or 
              reputational, but after seeing how they treat other girls that do not have a "reputation" as well, it is not like how they treat me at all. It is a little bit of 
              everything, but they treat me how they do because of a developed bias on me. Throughout all of my interactions with them, they have eyes focused on seeing and sometimes 
              even creating the worse conclusions they can about me. 
                <br/><br/>
              It took a while, but the day that I decided that I have reached my limits, I started to slowly stand up for myself and stopped being polite to these same people. That 
              was when they started to show their true colors and stopped showing the overlaying mask of politeness they insisted on having because of a mutual friend. They do not 
              see how contradictory their behaviors are&mdash;they were the ones that started treating me like I am some sort of criminal even though I have never done anything to them 
              and when I started to stick up for myself, they got annoyed and kept this silent grudge on me, creating this cold war every time I attend social events with them. On 
              top of that, when I stand up for myself, it only makes them think that I proved their points correct about how they think of me. All of this makes me scratch my head 
              even more; are they so blind to see that I am not the one that they should be wary of? They emphasize the importance of actions but disregard mine. My words and actions 
              have always aligned while theirs do not. They insist on my gift-giving to be a kiss-up or as a 'one-up' and my concerns to fakeness, all the while falling for these 
              same social traps they have set out for themselves. 
                <br/><br/>
              I cannot prevent how these people will continue to treat me and I certainly cannot control how they view me. If they insist on believing that I am this horrible person 
              that they cannot trust, there is nothing I could do but to continue to be myself. I will continue to give gifts even if they will continue to think that all I care 
              about is 'one-upping' them on what they give me. I will continue to express who I am even if they will continue to think I am this immature and insecure (or whatever 
              they call me) person. It is scary to find out what people, young and old, say about you behind your back. Do they not realize by now that paper cannot cover fire? 
                <br/><br/>
              I wanted to write this post because I have experienced countless situations where people I know treat me like an outcast because I do not behave like the rest of the 
              crowd, and I wanted to share it with anyone who may be experiencing something similar to this. From this post, I hope that you will be able to become a little bit more 
              aware of yourself to realize whether or not you are experiencing what I talked about. Perhaps you are in my shoes or perhaps you are in their shoes. My point is, do 
              not be afraid to be who you are. This is not new philosophy, but it is definitely hard when your endurance is tested. If the people around you does not accept you for 
              who you are, maybe it is time for you to find new people to surround yourself with. People who will help lift you up in your endeavors and vice versa. One last bit 
              that I will leave you is, do not play the game if it is not the game you are interested in playing.
                <br/><br/>
