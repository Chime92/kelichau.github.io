## Overview
#### Project Started April 2015
This website is a basic portfolio collection of my photography, film, designs, and web development works so that clients can view examples and contact information. It is constantly being updated with more efficient and dynamic coding as I continue to grow as an artist and web developer.

## Future Development
+ ~~Re-organize and minimize code and files (DRY KISS)~~
+ ~~Make website more mobile-friendly~~
+ ~~Increase loading speed for graphics~~
+ Convert entire website to MERN stack
