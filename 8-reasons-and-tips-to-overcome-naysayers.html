                  The people most supportive of you are also the same people that are less relative to you.
                    <br/><br/>
                  Do you agree with the statement above? This is something that I have been observing throughout
                  the years. Perhaps the people most supportive of you are judging you solely on your work. Maybe they
                  don't know you personally so they can't make any judgement about what of person you are. For those that
                  are more relative, it could be their partial judgement because of their relationship with you, or perhaps 
                  even insecurities. I think a lot of of you could relate to this, whether or not you realize this yourself, 
                  or have spoken openly about it.
                    <Br/><Br/>
                  When I say "less relative," I mean the ones that are usually, but not always, your acquaintances. Someone
                  that only knows you from school, from an event, or from what you share on your social media, but they have 
                  nothing else to judge you on. That decreases bias and allows them to judge you based solely on the work that 
                  you are sharing and how you are representing yourself.
                    <Br/><br/>
                  I believe your immediate family should be excluded from this theory. Parents and siblings are always (or I hope
                  they are), supporting you, no matter what you do. Besides the support from immediate family, if you are lucky
                  enough to find true friendship, then you are one in a million. You might not need me to say this, but be sure
                  to appreciate those relationships.
                    <Br/><br/>
                  Here is a list of reasons why I think people who are more relative to you may not necessarily support your 
                  endeavors, and my tips to overcome it, if this is the case in your situation.
                    <br/><br/>
                  <b>Reasons</b>:
                    <Br/><Br/>
                  1. <b>Biasness</b>: People who are closer to you will tend to think that they have a higher chance of making 
                  an accurate decision about you. They are more likely to believe what they think of you is true because they 
                  have the perception that they "understand" who you are, based on the amount of time and relationship
                  they have with you. Perhaps it's because you are closer to them. Humans have an innate competitiveness and
                  that occurs more with the people you know. Sometimes it could be your cousin wanting to compare their children
                  with yours or their successes with you. For example, they might feel the importance to want to end up with a bigger
                  house than you, a more reputable alma mater, or a more expensive car. This may sound a bit vain, but usually this 
                  kind of competitiveness is external and short-term.
                    <br/><br/>
                  2. <b>Underestimation</b>: This ties a little bit into number one. Majority of people only respect others that 
                  have a "good" reputation. A "good" reputation entails a high salary, owning expensive (interpreted as high 
                  quality) objects, and/or having better social experiences (showing that you have money to spend). All of which
                  are branches off of whether or not you attended college (if so, where? Is it an "ivy league"? Is it a popular
                  state university?) and career. The college you attend correlates to the job you receive upon graduation, but isn't
                  always necessarily causation. However, most people tend to be quick to believe that the determination of a person's
                  life success is the college they go to and how much money they will make afterwards.
                    <Br/><br/>
                  3. <b>Passive-Aggressiveness</b>: We all have or had that passive-aggressive relationship with someone. Be it your 
                  family member, relative, or friend. Depending on how you let it affect you, this could actually be very unhealthy.
                  If you do have one of these relationships, I recommend you to either slowly distance yourself with them, or just
                  build a good tolerance and learn how to handle the relationship so that it won't negatively affect you, all the while
                  still remaining true to your own character and beliefs. These PA people will tend to want to support you but might
                  have a bit of an ego, in which they only feel that they wouldn't want you to become better than them (on their 
                  own definition), due to their innate competitiveness and insecurity. They might not even be aware of their actions.
                  Nonetheless, you should always surround yourself with people who have similar principles to you, mostly people who
                  are confident and have strong passion toward their beliefs, and know how to support each other wholeheartedly, and not
                  the half-assed support that PA people tend to give.
                    <br/><br/>
                  4. <b>Insecurity</b>: All of the reasons above are in some way related to insecurity. If a person is one hundred percent
                  confident, that person understands what it takes to be happy. If a person is truly happy, that person is at peace, and
                  knows how to focus on their goals while being considerate at the same time to the ones around them. A confident person
                  will not have the time to think about comparing themselves to others, let alone act on it. They would usually be spending
                  their time wisely to find ways to improve themselves as a person and learning new things about who they are.
                    <br/><br/>
                  <b>Tips</b>:
                    <br/><br/>
                  5. <b>Be understanding</b>: Understand that these people are human. You are human. We all make mistakes. We all have our
                  own personal struggles. Don't hold these things against them, especially if it seems as if they aren't even aware of 
                  doing it to you. It's actually very tiring and takes you nowhere. It's much better if you try to let things go and just
                  accept things the way they are. This does not mean that you have to keep everyone in your life that is negative and bringing
                  you down. I'm not saying to just cut yourself off from society, but just try to be understanding. Everyone have their hard
                  days and maybe what you think isn't what you really know.
                    <br/><br/>
                  6. <b>Be the Initiator</b>: If you want to see where a person stands in your life and whether or not they support you, just
                  be honest to them and yourself. If you really want to know, you can take the initiative and ask them what they think of 
                  you. This is a two-way street, so of course you need to also be genuinely supporting them as well. Be the best judge that
                  you can be in picking the right people that are supportive of you and have similar beliefs as you.
                    <br/><br/>
                  7. <b>Be Open-Minded</b>: Keep an open mind. Don't jump to conclusions if you don't have enough evidence about where a
                  person stands in your life. Don't always believe what you hear and see. Things might not always be as they seem. If you
                  keep an open mind, it will allow you to listen better, and ultimately, learn better. It'll help you to not remain stubborn
                  if you find out that you were wrong about something, you'll learn from your mistakes. <i>You</i> are the student of <i>your</i>
                  life. Don't ever settle for a mediocre one. You don't know what happens when you die, so definitely make the best of it. Human
                  beings are social creatures, so relationships are just as an important part of everyone's lives. If you can learn to be open 
                  to new ideas, you will be able to get along with all different kinds of people and learn from them.
                    <br/><br/>
                  8. <b>Be Inspiring</b>: If you notice these things and you have no idea how to handle it, just be inspiring, by being the honest
                  you. Use whatever it is that you're doing to show them that you are persistent and serious. If you want to become a teacher, work 
                  hard on your goals and become one. If you want to become your own boss of a restaurant and there are doubts coming your way, just
                  work hard for your goals. Accomplish your goals and when the time comes with the result, you can show those people. I don't mean
                  "shove it in their face". I mean to show them that because you were able to do it, so can they. Most of the time, people who are 
                  insecure or underestimate others only do so because they don't think they can amount to something themselves. Having someone 
                  relative to them, showing them otherwise, could definitely be a huge motivation.
                    <br/><br/>
                  Of course, there are always other possible explanations. I could be one hundred percent incorrect. I came up with these reasons and
                  tips based off of my experience on being on both sides of the coin. I'll always keep an open-mind and I hope that you were able to do 
                  the same while you were reading this post.
                    <br/><br/>
                  What do you think about this innate competitiveness that we all have experienced at one point or another? Do you agree with anything
                  I've written? Disagree? Feel free to let me know if you're interested in a discussion.
                    <br/><br/>
                  As always, thanks for reading and feel free to leave some feedback on what you would be interested in seeing or what I can improve to 
                  make this a better reading experience for you.
