              "The people most supportive of you are also the same people that are less relative to you."
                <br/><br/>
              Do you agree with the statement above? This is something that I have been observing throughout the years. Perhaps the people most supportive
              of you are judging you solely on your work. Maybe they don't know you personally so they can't make any judgement about what kind of person
              you are. For those that are more relative, it could be their partial judgement because of their relationship to you, or perhaps even insecurities.
              I think a lot of you could relate to this, whether or not you realize this yourself, or have spoken openly about it.
                <br/><br/>
              When I say "less relative", I mean the ones that are usually, but not always, your acquaintances. Someone that only knows you from school, from
              an event, or from what you share on your social media, but they have nothing else to judge you on. That decreases the bias and allows them to judge
              you based solely on the work you are sharing and how you are representing yourself.
                <br/><br/>
              I believe your immediate family should be excluded form this theory. Parents and siblings are always, (or I hope they should be), supporting you,
              no matter what you do. I am fortunate enough to have that and incredibly grateful for it. Besides the support from immediate family, if you are
              lucky enough to find true friendship, then you are one in a million. You might not need me to say this, but be sure to appreciate those relationships.
                <br/><br/>
              Here is a list of reasons why I think people who are more relative to you may not necessarily support your endeavors, and my tips to overcome it,
              if this is the case in your situation.
                <br/><br/>
              <div class=write-sub>Reasons</div>
                <br/>
              <p class=write-sub-sub>1. Biasness</p>
              People who are closer to you will tend to have a higher chance of making an accurate decision about you. They are more likely to 
              believe what they think is true because they have the perception that they understand who you are, based on the amount of time and relationship 
              they have with you. Perhaps it's because you are closer to them. Humans have an innate competitiveness and that occurs more with the people you 
              know. Sometimes it could be your cousin wanting to compare their children with yours or their successes with you. For example, they might feel 
              the importance to want to end up with a bigger house than you, a better reputation alma mater, or a more expensive car. This may sound a bit 
              vain, but usually this kind of competitiveness is external and short-term.
                <br/><br/>
              <p class=write-sub-sub>2. Underestimation</p> 
              This ties a little bit into number one. Majority of people only respect others that have a 'good' reputation. A good 
              reputation entails a high salary, owning expensive (interpreted as high quality) objects, and/or having better social experiences (showing that 
              you have money to spend). All of which are branches off of whether or not you attended college (If so, where? Is it an ivy league? Is it a 
              popular state university?) and career. The college you attend correlates to the job you receive upon graduation, but isn't always necessarily 
              causation. However, most people tend to be quick to believe that the determination of a person's life success is the college they go to and how 
              much money they will make afterwards.
                <br/><br/>
              <p class=write-sub-sub>3. Passive-Aggresiveness</p>
              We all have or had that passive-aggressive relationship with someone. Be it your family member, relative, or friend. Depending on how you let 
              it affect it you, this could actually be very unhealthy. If you do have one of these relationships, I recommend you to either slowly distance 
              yourself with them, or just build a good tolerance and learn how to handle the relationship so that it won't negatively affect you. These PA 
              people will tend to want to support you but might have a bit of an ego, in which they only feel that they wouldn't want you to become better 
              than them (on their own definition), due to their innate competitiveness. They might not even be aware of their actions. Nonetheless, you should 
              always surround yourself with people who have similar goals to you and know how to support each other wholeheartedly, and not the half-assed 
              support that PA people tend to give.
                <br/><br/>
              <p class=write-sub-sub>4. Insecurity</p>
              All of the reasons above are in someway related to insecurity. If a person is one hundred percent confident, that person understands what it 
              takes to be happy. If a person is truly happy, that person is at peace, and knows how to focus on their goals while being considerate at the 
              same time to the ones around them. A confident person will not have the time to think about comparing themselves to others, let alone act on it. 
              They would usually be spending their time wisely to find ways to improve themselves as a person and learning new things about who they are. 
                <br/><br/>
              <div class=write-sub>Tips</div>
                <br/>
              <p class=write-sub-sub>1. Be Understanding</p>
              Understand that these people are human. You are human. We all make mistakes. We all have our own personal struggles. Don't hold these things 
              against them, especially if it seems as if they aren't even aware of doing it to you. It's actually very tiring and takes you nowhere. It's much
              better if you try to let things go and just accept things the way it is. This doe not mean that you have to keep everyone in your life that is 
              negative and bringing you down. I'm not saying to just cut yourself off from society, but just try to be understanding. Everyone have their bad 
              days and maybe what you think isn't what you really know.
                <br/><br/>
              <p class=write-sub-sub>2. Be the Initiator</p>
              If you want to see where a person stands in your life and whether or not they support you, just be honest to them and yourself. If you really 
              want to know, you can take the initiative and ask them what they think of you. This is a two-way street, so of course you need to also be 
              genuinely supporting them as well. Be the best judge that you can be in picking the right people that are supportive of you and have similar 
              goals to you.
                <br/><br/>
              <p class=write-sub-sub>3. Be Open-Minded</p>
              Keep an open mind. Don't jump to conclusions if you don't have enough evidence about where a person stands in your life. Don't always believe 
              what you hear and see. Things might not always be as they seem. If you keep an open mind, it will allow you to listen better, and, ultimately, 
              learn better. You are a student of your life. Don't ever settle for a mediocre one. You don't know what happens when you die, so definitely make 
              the best of it. Human beings are social creatures, so relationships are just as an important part of everyone's lives. If you can learn to be 
              open to new ideas, you will be able to get along with all different kinds of people.
                <br/><br/>
              <p class=write-sub-sub>4. Be Inspiring</p>
              If you notice these things and you have no idea how to handle it, just be inspiring, by being you. Use whatever it is that you're doing to show 
              them that you are persistent and serious. If you want to become a teacher, work hard on your goals and become one. If you want to become your own
              boss of a restaurant and there are doubts coming your way, just work hard for your goals. Accomplish your goals and when the time comes with the 
              result, you can show those people. I don't mean shove it in their face. I mean to show them that because you were able to do it, so can they. 
              Most of the time, people who are insecure or underestimate others only do so because they don't think they can amount to something themselves. 
              Having someone relative to them, showing them otherwise, could definitely be a huge motivation.
                <br/><br/>
              Of course, there are always other possible explanations. I could be one hundred percent incorrect. I came up with these reasons and tips based 
              off of my experience on being on both sides of the coin. I'll always keep an open-mind and I hope that you were able to do the same while you 
              were reading this post.
