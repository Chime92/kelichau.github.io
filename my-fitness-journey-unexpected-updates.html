                    I understand how tough it is to keep going when you do not see immediate results. For some, it is easier for them to maintain their workout regimen, but 
                    for others there is a mental struggle. In order to keep going, you need to keep in mind that you are not only in it to lose weight, to look good, or to prove 
                    something to others. This is about building a long-lasting habit that you will carry with you for the rest of your life. It is a lifestyle. The first step? 
                    Rid yourself of your attachment to results.
                      <br/><Br/>
                    For me, I have struggled with a healthy routine for basically my entire life until a couple of years ago (you can read the back story 
                    <a href="http://www.kellychau.net/my-fitness-journey-a-back-story">here</a>). I was skinny fat 
                    and then I became fat-fat. Skinny fat is when you appear skinny on the outside, which makes it easier for people to mistaken you as fit and healthy, but you 
                    have little to no muscle, which affects your metabolism and how you digest food. Being skinny fat will end up making you unhealthy even if you do not look 
                    like it on the outside. So even though I looked skinny on the outside, I got sick easily every single year, my body was always pale, and I could barely run 
                    one mile when I tried. When I graduated high school, my metabolism drastically slowed. Add on my lack on muscles at the time and it started to affect my
                    health. Not only did I gain extra weight in fat, I was also unhealthy on the inside. I was still experiencing everything I did when I was skinny fat, but 
                    now I just had a lot more fat that were visible on the outside.   
                      <br/><br/>
                    My roller coaster started when I decided to do something about my change in health. I started researching vigorously and tried countless methods of becoming
                    healthy. I did not only want to lose the extra “weight”, but I wanted to become healthy, permanently. Many of the methods I chose included changing my diet, 
                    running three miles each day, weight training at the gym. After some more research and realizing what I needed for myself, I came up with my own schedule that
                    I enjoy doing with the help of Tony Horton’s P90X3 program. 
                      <br/><br/>
                    The truth is, I wanted to share my recent down in my fitness journey. I did not go into a full-blown relapse, but I had two minor surgeries within the past 
                    seven months. Although they were minor surgeries, I had to rest for a month each time before I could fully recover and start doing strenuous exercises. By 
                    the time I recovered physically, I had to work on preparing my mentality back to where it was before I had the surgeries, because this is not something I 
                    want to do to lose the weight and be done with, this is a habit that I want to create for myself. While I was working on that, I still maintained my diet, 
                    limiting and cutting out red meat to name an example. On top of that, I was still using my muscles. My metabolism never slowed down because of all the muscle 
                    I gained and kept when I was working out.  
                      <br/><br/>
                    Some people who read my fitness back story last year ended up with exaggerated expectations of how they think I “should look”, a couple of months after 
                    they read the entry and when I attend socialization events or mini gatherings now. I never claimed to have a six-pack or that I was super fit, it is called a
                    “back story”. It is my journey. If you know me, then you should know by now that I emphasize the importance of appreciating the journey more than the results.
                    I would have been betraying myself if I did not let go of my ego and post up that entry to share with everyone. 
                      <br/><br/>
                    Perhaps my fitness progress blog entry was interpreted as exaggeration, maybe people might have gotten offended by some of the things I said, or maybe some 
                    people contain too much ego to resist comparison and unconstructive criticism. 
                      <br/><br/>
                    Although the judgement is on a spectrum scale, it still falls under them being too quick to judge me when they see that I am still “fat”. I know this because 
                    they are always staring directly down at my stomach when I see them (as if I would not notice), they do not bother to catch up with me but rather focus on my 
                    boyfriend instead and asking him how has he been doing in his fitness journey, or they would sarcastically ask me how if “I am still working out” since they 
                    see that I still look the same like I did last September or think that I gained more weight than I did last year. 
                      <br/><br/>
                    They automatically assume that I did not put my money where my mouth is. I want to throw this out there even though it is something we all should know by 
                    now—they should not be jumping to conclusions about my fitness journey or about my, or anyone’s, life in general. They surely would not like it when other
                    people do it to them. Whatever happened to “treating others how you would like to be treated”? 
                      <br/><br/>
                    Remember when I mentioned earlier about being “skinny fat”? I may have a little more weight on me now, but I feel healthier than I ever did in my life. 
                    Some of you are keeping up with me, some are looking for inspiration, and some are just curious, so I wanted to share with you all why I have not posted up 
                    Part II of my fitness journey yet. It is not because I am a prideful person wanting to exaggerate my accomplishments, focusing on proving others wrong, nor 
                    is it because I have relapsed and went back to my old ways. Be on the lookout for sporadic updates of my progress in the next several months by subscribing 
                    to my mailing list on the 'Contact' tab or adding me on your favorite social media accounts. There were unexpected things that happened which caused me to 
                    temporarily pause my workout regimen. Unexpected things are a part of life… and I was living.
