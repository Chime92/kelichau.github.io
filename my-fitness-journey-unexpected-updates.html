                  I understand how tough it is to keep going when you do not see immediate results. For some, it is easier for them to maintain 
                  their workout regimen, but for others, there is a mental struggle. In order to keep going, you need to keep in mind that you 
                  are not only in it to lose weight, to look good, or to prove something to others. This is about building a long-lasting habit
                  that you will carry with you for the rest of your life. The first step? Rid yourself of your attachment to results.
                    <br/><br/>
                  For me, I have struggled with a healthy routine for basically my entire life until a couple of years ago (you can read the back
                  story <u><a href="http://www.kelianachau.com/my-fitness-journey-a-back-story" class="links2">here</a></u>). I was "skinny fat" and then 
                  I became "fat-fat". "Skinny fat" is when you appear skinny on the outside, which makes it easier for people to mistaken you as fit
                  and healthy, but you have little to no muscle, which affects your metabolism and how you digest food. Being skinny fat will end
                  up making you unhealthy even if you do not look like it on the outside. So even though I looked skinny on the outside, I got sick
                  easily every single year, my body was always frail and pale, and I could barely run one mile when I tried with all my strength.
                  When I graduated high school, my metabolism drastically slowed. Add on my lack of muscles at the time, and it started to affect
                  my health. Not only did I gain extra weight in fat, I was also unhealthy on the inside. I was still experiencing everything I did 
                  when I was "skinny fat," but now I just had more fat that were visible on the outside.
                    <br/><br/>
                  My roller coaster started when I decided to do something about my change in health. I started researching vigorously and tried
                  countless methods of becoming healthy. I did not only want to lose the extra "weight," but I wanted to become healthy, permanently.
                  Many of the methods I chose included changing my diet, running three miles each day, weight training at the gym. After some more
                  research and realizing what I needed for myself, I came up with my own schedule that I enjoy doing with the help of Tony Horton's
                  P90X3 program.
                    <br/><br/>
                  The truth is, I wanted to share my recent down in my fitness journey. I did not go into a full-blown relapse, but I had two minor
                  surgeries within the past seven months. Although they were minor surgeries, I had to rest for a month each time before I could fully
                  recover and start doing strenuous exercises. By the time I recovered physically, I had to work on preparing my mentality back to where 
                  it was before I had the surgeries, because this is not something that I want to do to lose weight and be done with it; this is a habit
                  that I want to create for myself. While I was working on that, I still maintained my diet, limiting and cutting out red meat to name
                  an example. On top of that, I was still using my muscles. My metabolism never slowed down because of all the muscle I gained and kept 
                  when I was working out.
                    <br/><br/>
                  Some people who read my fitness back story last year ended up with exaggerated expectations of how they think I "should look," a couple 
                  of months after they read the entry when I attend socialization events or mini gatherings now. I never claimed to have a "six-pack" or 
                  that I was "super fit". It is called a <i>back story</i>. It is my <i>journey</i>. If you know me, then you should know by now that I emphasize
                  the importance of appreciating the journey more than the results. I would have been betraying myself if I did not let go of my ego and post
                  up that entry to share with everyone.
                    <Br/><br/>
                  Perhaps my fitness progress blog entry was interpreted as exaggeration, maybe people might have gotten offended by some of the things I
                  said, or maybe some people contain too much ego to resist comparison and unconstructive criticism.
                    <br/><br/>
                  Although the judgement is on a spectrum scale, it still falls under them being too quick to judge me when they see that I am still "fat".
                  I know this because they are always staring directly down at my stomach when I see them (as if I would not notice), they do not bother to
                  catch up with me but rather focus on my boyfriend instead, and asking him how has he been doing in his fitness journey, or they would
                  sarcastically ask me if "I'm still working out," since they see that I still look the "same" like I did last September, or think that I gained
                  more weight than I did last year. All of those opinions are fine, if they weren't beating around the bush about it.
                    <br/><br/>
                  They automatically assume that I did not put my money where my mouth is. I want to throw this out there even though it is something we 
                  all should know by now&mdash;they should not be jumping to conclusions about my fitness journey, or about my, or anyone's, life in 
                  general. They surely would not like it when other people do it to them. Whatever happened to "treating others how you would like to be
                  treated"?
                    <br/><Br/>
                  Remember when I mentioned earlier about being "skinny fat"? I may have a little more weight on me now, but it is mostly muscle. I know 
                  this because I feel healthier than I ever did in my life. Some of you are keeping up with me, some are looking for inspiration, and some 
                  are just curious, so I wanted to share with you all why I have not posted up Part II of my fitness journey yet. It is not because I am 
                  a prideful person wanting to exaggerate my accomplishments, focusing on proving others wrong. Nor is it because I have relapsed and went 
                  back to my old ways. There were unexpected things that happened which caused me to temporarily pause my workout regimen. Unexpected things 
                  are a part of life... and I was living.
